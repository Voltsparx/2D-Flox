2. **Client:** Enter host IP in "Join (IP)" field and click "Join"
3. Play over LAN with automatic reconnection/backoff

## Game Mechanics

- Ships cannot cross the center line; bullets can
- Health decreases when hit; ships dim as damage accumulates
- First player to destroy opponent wins
- Each ship has unique attack patterns and charge behaviors

## Ship Abilities

- **Zaba** (Square): Charged block attack
- **Rekin** (Triangle): Fast triple-shot
- **Osa** (Circle): Rapid-fire spread
- **Komar** (Kite): Laser beam with full-screen coverage
- **Kombuz** (Hexagon): Mine-layer with distance-based explosion
- **Gwiazdka** (Star): Scatter shot and nova burst
- **Rift** (Boomerang): Returning projectiles with sweep attack
- **Nexus** (Cross): Cross-pattern special attack

## Networking

- **Host-Authoritative:** Server maintains game state; clients send input and render interpolated snapshots
- **Reconnection:** Automatic exponential backoff (18 seconds) on connection loss
- **Client Interpolation:** Smooth position transitions for remote ships (22% alpha per frame)
- **Keyboard Input Only:** No latency from UI interactions
